An input field for guessing the number
A button for submitting a guess
A button for clearing the input field
A button that resets the game to its initial state
An element that displays the users most recent guess

If their guess is too high, it should display: “Sorry, that guess is too high. Try a lower number.”
If their guess is too low, it should display: “Sorry, that guess is too low. Try a higher number.”
The type attribute for the guess input should be “number”.
It should have “min” and a “max” attributes equal to the minimum and maximum of the reange of guesses (e.g. 1 and 100, respectively).
The application should display an error message if the guess is not a number (e.g. parseInt() returns NaN).

The clear button should be disabled if there is nothing to clear.
The reset button should be disabled if there is nothing to reset.
